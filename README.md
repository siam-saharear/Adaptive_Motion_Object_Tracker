**Project Overview**

Adaptive_Motion_Object_Tracker is built to detect movement in video files or live footage.

It keeps count of objects passing through frames and, based on their previous movement, predicts their future trajectory. The system shows a path marker along with the probability of an object moving in a certain direction.

As the frames go on, the system learns from past movement and becomes more accurate over time
